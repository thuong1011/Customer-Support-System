# Customer-Support-System
This project is a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system developed using .NET Web API for the backend and Angular for the frontend. The system is designed to help businesses manage customer interactions, streamline processes, and improve customer satisfaction.

The backend API handles user authentication, data management, and business logic, utilizing Entity Framework Core for database interactions and JWT for secure authentication. The frontend, built with Angular, provides a responsive and user-friendly interface, enabling users to manage customer information, track interactions, and generate reports. The system is structured to be scalable, maintainable, and capable of integrating with other business systems.
